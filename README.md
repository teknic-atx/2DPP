A responsive 2D platformer controller prototype for Unity

![Screenie](Screenie.PNG)

This is the demo project and slides from my Crafting Game Feel workshop at GDC^2 on Feb 29, 2020. The project demonstrates methods for creating a simple but responsive 2D platformer system using a rigidbody, high frequency physics tick rate, air/ground control, and direct velocity manipulation to allow interaction with native physics elements.

Requires Unity 2019.3.2
